# webpage_ab_test
In this Udacity project, I use bootstrapping, z_tests, and logistic regression models to calculate p-values for an A/B test. I use two datasets provided by Udacity, 'ab_data.csv' which has a row for each user's conversion response (1 or 0) to either a control or treatment landing page, and 'countries.csv', which contains the country for each user.

In python, I use statsmodels.api for the z-test and logistic regression model. I also use numpy and pandas for data manipulation, as well as matplotlib for data visualization
